	<h4>Reia Character Design Notes</h4>

	<p>
		<i>Reia is the main character of the game. She's one of the four recently created Ethereals.</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Personality and Traits:</b>
		Curious, brave, and empathetic. Reia has a strong sense of justice and a desire to help others. She
		is also highly intelligent and resourceful. She's kind and compassionate to those who live the world
		she created.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Physical Appearance:</b>
		Reia has a toned build with long, braided hair that glows with a soft, ethereal light. She has bright,
		expressive eyes and a warm smile. Her clothing is practical yet stylish, designed for adventure.
		She has a pendant on her sash near her hip. Inside of it is a star representing her symbol. This
		same symbol appears 3 times on her necklace and once at the end of her hair braid.
		<br />
		Her outfit is a mid-length dress with a high slit on one side for mobility. The dress is adorned
		with gold clips on the sides and she has a light shawl draped over her shoulders. Her dress also
		curves and tapers off at the ends.
		<br />
		She wears wedges that lace up to her calves. The wedges have a slight heel for style but are still
		practical. On the back of the wedges is her symbol along with some extra designs. The overall color
		palette is white with a subtle mix of all of the elements (fire, water, earth, air, light, dark)
		with an ombr√© design. And gold accents for jewelry.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Abilities and Powers:</b>
		Reia isn't particularly strong with any one speicific element. However, she has a natural affinity
		for all elements, allowing her to adapt to various situations. Her mastery over using multiple abilities
		allows her to combine elements in creative ways, making her strong in a unique way.

	<h2>Technical Design</h2>
	<blockquote>
		This section outlines the technical aspects of the game's development, including the game
		engine, graphics rendering, scripting languages, web programming, data handling, and
		specifications and scope.
	</blockquote>

	<h3>Game Programming</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Game Engine: The Godot Game Engine (v4.5+).</li>
		<li>
			Graphics Rendering: Vulkan & Direct3D 12 support for both high-performance graphics and old
			GPUs. OpenGL ES 3.0 support web (HTML5) platforms and all companion releases.
		</li>
		<li>
			Programming Languages: GDScript for high-level programming, Rust through gdext for more
			performance.
		</li>
		<li>Shader Languages: GDShader/GLSL.</li>
		<li>Localization: Godot's built-in translation system.</li>
		<li>Networking: Sustenet, our custom networking solution built in Rust.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Web Programming</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Frontend: SvelteKit & Tailwind CSS for optimizations and SEO. Paraglide for i18n translations.
		</li>
		<li>
			Backend: Vercel with Supabase for user authentication and storage. It'll also link with Turso
			to load specific user data.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Data Handling</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Authentication: Turso through Rust handles all OpenID Connect (OIDC) auths for Steam / Epic
			Games / other platforms and also email / password signups. This gets linked to a Supabase
			account to be used on the website.
		</li>
		<li>Online Database: Turso with Rust for authentication and core game data.</li>
		<li>Offline Support: Turso with Rust enables seamless online and offline play.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Specs & Scope</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Target Platforms: PC, Mobile support, and a heavy focus on Console ports later. The companion
			app will be a trimmed down 2D version of the game with a focus on crafting, gathering, and
			social features. It'll also have combat, but it'll be more casual and less intensive than the
			main game. This app is available on all platforms, including web (HTML5).
		</li>
		<li>Team Size: Core Team and community contributors.</li>
		<li>
			Project Timeline: We're aiming for an alpha release around May 2026. If it takes longer, we'll
			postpone to reach our goal properly for the following year. But we want the release to be in
			May for a Kickstarter.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Production Design</h2>
	<blockquote>
		This section covers the plans for marketing, monetization, platform availability, funding, and
		the overall production timeline.
	</blockquote>

	<ol>
		<li>...</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Marketing (details to be added later)</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>...</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Monetization (details to be added later)</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			How will the game make money? Premium purchase? F2P? How do you justify this within the
			design?
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The game will be free to play on all platforms. However, there will be optional paid content
		such as cosmetics, expansions, and a premium membership that offers quality of life features and
		early access to new content. This approach allows us to keep the game accessible to everyone
		while still generating revenue to support ongoing development and server costs. This content can
		still be accessed without paying money. If a friend has the content unlocked, in most cases, you
		can use it as well without paying.
	</p>

	<h3>Platforms</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>PC (Windows / Mac / Linux)</li>
		<li>Mobile (iOS / Android)</li>
		<li>Web (HTML5)</li>
		<li>Console (PS5 / XBOX / Nintendo Switch)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The plan is to make the game accessible on multiple platforms, ensuring a wide reach and
		engagement from various user bases. There's a strong focus on PC support. Mobile comes second,
		and console comes third. The companion app is uniform across all platforms. The role of the
		companion app is to allow players to engage with the game world in a more casual and social
		manner, focusing on crafting, gathering, and light combat. It serves as a complement to the main
		game, providing a different experience. You'll be able to manage things about your account and
		character throug the companion app.
	</p>

	<h3>Funding (details to be added later)</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Self-funded: We went this route to stay true to the purpose of this project. To provide
			something everyone loves without changing it up for profits. And if we run out of money,
			that's okay. The project doesn't magically die.
		</li>
		<li>
			Crowdfunded: We want to allow the community to support the game as well. Their support goes
			straight into things that will obviously get a return. Payments to contributors through our
			Open Collective and server costs as well.
		</li>
	</ol>
