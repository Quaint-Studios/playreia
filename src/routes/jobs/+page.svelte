						<h3>Outreach</h3>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								The ideal candidate for the <strong>outreach position</strong> would be someone who has
								experience sending well-written emails to a mass group of people and can keep in touch
								with them all. This candidate would be responsible for upkeeping the relations with them.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							This requires sending emails out to other companies for articles and backlinks to
							cover the project. It also requires engaging with other creators, gamers, developers,
							and people that are simply interested in the idea of this project. This person would
							be responsible for getting the word out.
						</p>

						<p>
							While we have a list of companies and individuals to reach out to, we're looking for
							someone who knows how to get in touch with more. The goal is to spread awareness so
							the ball doesn't stop with our existing list. It'll continuously grow. And we don't
							plan to do spammy contacts. We want to actually get to know them personally.
						</p>

						<h3>Social Media Management</h3>
						<p>
							This job would require someone who knows the technical side of what's going on in the
							project and can explain it to the public in a way that can be widely understood. This
							person would be responsible for posting on all of the socials and keeping the
							community updated on what's going on with the project.
						</p>
						<p>
							This website has all of the socials on it at the bottom. They're all @playreia for
							YouTube, TikTok, Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Bluesky is
							registered @playreia.com. We won't really be posting on any of those accounts until we
							launch the live pre-alpha and post it on Steam. Bluesky has been getting occasionally
							updates recetly.
